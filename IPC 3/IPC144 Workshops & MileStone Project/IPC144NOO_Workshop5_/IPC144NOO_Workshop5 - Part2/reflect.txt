1. Mapping the month integer value to the first three characters of the month name could have been
accomplished using one of two possible selection constructs. What are they, and provide a short example of
how each would be written in C to display the last two months?

==> Those two selection constructs are : Switch and else-if ladder or if-else construct.
==> For example,
I. Switch statement :
Switch(month){
		case 1: printf("JAN");
			break;
		case 2: printf("FEB");
			break;
		case 3: printf("MAR");
			break;
		case 4: printf("APR");
			break;
		case 5: printf("MAY");
			break;
		case 6: printf("JUN");
			break;
		case 7: printf("JUL");
			break;
		case 8: printf("AUG");
			break;
		case 9: printf("SEP");
			break;
		case 10: printf("OCT");
			break;
		case 11: printf("NOV");
			break;
		case 12: printf("DEC");
			break;
}


II. ELSE-IF LADDER : 

If(month==1){
 printf(ÒJANÓ);
}
Else if(month==2){
Printf(ÒFEBÓ);
}
-----
-----
Else{
Printf(ÒDECÓ);
}


2. The logic applied to validate the values entered by the user required iteration. What are the 3 types of iteration
constructs? What one did you use for the validation routines, and briefly explain why?
==> The three iteration constructs are :
i. For loop 
ii. While loop
iii. Do-while loop
The one construct which I used for this workshop was Ð do while loop, since do while loop is an exit controlled loop, so it is really easy to execute the instructions once even if the input entered by the user is false. 
Thats the reason, I used do while loop in this workshop.

3. Describe what you did to test and debug your program. How did you go about finding where the problems
were located (explain how you did this for both syntactic and semantic problems)?
Actually, I ran the program on the debug console of the VS code and in order to find the syntactic errors, I went through each line of the program and searched for any kind of possible syntactic errors like : if the program has any statement without the semicolon (Ò;Ó), if the variable isnÕt being declared but has been assigned a value, such type of errors and also, for the semantic errors Ð the errors are in the output (compile-time errors) so I actually went and understand my loopÕs logic and try to evaluate the conditions in the loops in mind and fixed those issues by evaluating and filtering all the possible cases that the program might take within while considering the input values entered by the user, with the conditions mentioned in the loop.
