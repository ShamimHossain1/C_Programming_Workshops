1. It appears that you have successfully coded non-repetitive sections of 
   logic in the game play portion. The use of loops and conditionals allows you 
   to efficiently display the game board, player position, and handle player 
   moves. Your code uses loops to draw the ruler, board, and handle player 
   movement, making it non-repetitive. The logic is organized and structured, 
   which improves code readability and maintainability.

2. The use of structures simplifies your program in several ways:
   - It encapsulates related data into meaningful structures 
     (PlayerInfo and GameInfo), which makes it easier to manage 
     and access the game's state.
   - It allows you to pass structured data as function arguments,
     reducing the need for multiple individual variables.
   - By storing related data within structures, your code is more 
     organized and self-documenting. It's clear that player.lives 
     represents the player's lives, and game.path_length represents 
     the path length.
   - Structures make it easier to extend the game's functionality by 
     adding more attributes to the player or game without significantly 
     altering the code.

3. In your code, the maximum number of levels of nesting appears to be one. 
   Here's a simplified outline to illustrate the nesting structure:
   - Level 1:
     - while (!is_done)
       - Inside the while loop, you have several conditional statements and 
         loops that are not nested more deeply. Each of these constructs is 
         at the same level of nesting.
